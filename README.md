<h1>Image Resizer</h1>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is a user interface to the <a href="https://github.com/masterexploder/PHPThumb" target="_blank">PHPThumb class</a>. I created this web interface because I needed to resize some images and I knew that this class would do the job, so instead of seaching for a software to resize the images I created that interface to do it.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>A webserver with PHP.</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Create two folders: "in" and "out". Put the files in the "in" folder and follow the instructions at index.php. The resized files will be at the "out" folder.</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>Do whatever you want (aka MIT License)</p>
